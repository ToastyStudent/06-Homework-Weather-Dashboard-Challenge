# 06-Homework-Weather-Dashboard-Challenge

## Description
This project was built from code provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp's TAs, with me rewriting code in order to ensure I understand how to properly build the app were I to attempt to do so again under less time constraints than those I am currently under.

Specifically, I utilized Javascript, HTML, and Jquery in conjunction with the OpenWeatherApi to construct a 5-Day weather forecast that succesfully employs a API Get request to display data.

# Installation and Usage
No installation is required. One only needs to visit the deployed github pages page for this project in order to interact/use it properly. 

Said interaction/usage would involve attemtping to search for the weather of a given city on the current day and 5 ones in the future via the search input on the page.

# Credits
This entire project was built using code provided by Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp TAs from the following repository:

https://nu.bootcampcontent.com/NU-Coding-Bootcamp/NU-VIRT-FSF-PT-01-2023-U-LOLC/-/tree/main/00-homework-solutions/06-Main

With their express permission, I used the code provided as a template which I then modified, primarily through the renaming of elements, addition/modification of comments, and rearrangemet of variables.

For this particular assignment, I refrained from modified anything in the jass.css file due to the amount of normalize styling (i.e styling meant to have the assignment render properly regardless of the device used) to avoid potentially breaking the application.
